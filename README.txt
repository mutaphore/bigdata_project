/crawler
Python scrapy web crawler responsible for crawling urls retrieved from HN/Reddit
and save the content of those webpages as well as various metadata.

/datumbox
Machine learning framework from datumbox.com. The framework can be used
to perform many types of analysis such as sentiment analysis, topic
classication, keyword extration etc. on a large dataset.
Currently our project is not using this framework; however it can be an
additional add-on analysis toolbox later if we want to do a more
in-depth study.

/hackernews

process_hn_crawl_output.hql - cleans the HN crawl output file to remove commas, NULL fields, etc. for easier processing later
filter_hn_api_fields.py - this script contains the transform function used by process_hn_api_output.hql 
filter_hn_crawl_fields.py - this script contains the transform function used by process_hn_crawl_output.hql
join_output_and_crawl.hql - joins the HN api dataset with crawled dataset so we can get further correlation info
get_reddit_output.hql - cleans and export reddit dataset to local directory
remove_fields_comma.py - an udf used by hive to remove comma from title field so that data can be process by mapreduce job

getposts.py - depricated
output.csv - raw reddit post data collected by calling reddit api from reddit.py script
